# Handoff — where the project stands

**Current as of `d61a646`, 2026-08-16.** This is the working note for whoever
picks the project up next: the state of play, what is waiting on the author, and
what I would take next. It is **current state only** — history lives in
[handoff-archive.md](handoff-archive.md), and anything durable has been moved
out of here on purpose:

- [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) — the operating manual: commands, conventions that
  are easy to get wrong, and how to drive the game in a browser.
- [README.md](../README.md) — the design: what is implemented, the **rules
  decisions**, the gap list and the roadmap.
- [docs/mechanics.he.md](mechanics.he.md) — the rules document itself.
- [docs/balance.md](balance.md) — every number that was chosen rather than
  transcribed, and the interactions to preserve when tuning them.

## Green as of this commit

```
npm test            281 tests, 14 files
npm run typecheck   clean
```

The demo scenario plays end to end in the browser, including the debrief. The
rule is that nothing is called done on tests alone: if a player can see it, it
gets driven in the actual game first.

## Waiting on the author

**Nothing.** Every rules decision in the README is ✅ as of 2026-08-16 — the
⚠️ list is empty for the first time. Do not reopen one without him.

Two are ✅ *as decisions* while their **numbers** are still ours. They belong to
the balance pass, not to the rules list, and live on
[balance.md](balance.md):

| | Chosen | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Decision 9 | smoke radii **25 / 50 / 100 m** | The document sizes no screen. |
| Decision 13 | casualty bands **0 / 1–2 / 3–5 / 6+** | He confirmed that reports are banded, not where the bands fall. |

**Decision 11's riders** (no assault on armour, no ammunition tracking) remain
assumptions he has not contradicted; ammunition is backlog 12's job.

So the next rules question is a **new** one, and terrain is it.

## Do not re-propose

Closed deliberately, with reasons that are not obvious from the code:

- **An artillery battery as a standalone unit.** Indirect fire is off-map
  *because* the playable slice is the platoon-leader view — a platoon commander
  calls for fire rather than owning guns. The battery arrives with **echelon
  scaling** (backlog 3) and not before (decision 8).
- **Reading the cover modifier as percentage points.** Settled on the document's
  own grammar, not on the arithmetic (decision 7).
- **A flat bonus for a sector of observation.** It made the width control a trap
  — the widest arc dominated every narrower one. The bonus is divided by the
  arc's width for that reason (decision 14).
- **Raising the charge trigger radius to the 20 m search band.** The gap between
  10 m and 20 m is the ground where a charge is found without being trodden on,
  which is the only thing the search roll buys (decision 10).

## Do not re-derive

Measurements that cost real time and are already recorded:

- **Charges, before the decision-10 fix:** a charge 5 m off the route at the
  midpoint of a 50 m walk fired **200/200 seeds and was found 0/200**.
- **Hidden enemy, same shape:** a stationary squad 15 m beside a 50 m walk was
  found **0/400** from the endpoint against **~26%** beside the halt.
- **Sector bonus by width:** `13.5 ÷ width` → +23% / +15% / +8% at
  60° / 90° / 180°, against a flat −20% outside.

## What I would pick up next

1. **Terrain** (backlog 6) — and it needs the author more than it needs code.
   The document has **no terrain table at all**, so this is the biggest rules
   invention left, bigger than sectors were. Everything now points at it:
   `baseCover` sits on a `Unit` with nothing to set it, line of sight only knows
   about smoke, the map is a bare field, and a sector now tells a force where to
   look with nothing on the ground to look at or from behind. Bring him a
   proposal with the tradeoffs already worked out — he settles a well-framed
   question in one line, and he checks new mechanics for dominated options.
2. **Laying charges during play.** Small and self-contained, but the document
   does not describe engineering work at all — ask before building.
3. **Morale** (backlog 1). The neutralise rule is the only cohesion model; the
   posture system is the natural place to hang suppression.

Two I would *not* rush: **echelon scaling** (backlog 3) touches the C2 model
everywhere and has since picked up the artillery battery, which makes it larger
rather than more urgent; and **OPORD mode** (backlog 13) is a research project
with a section of its own in the README.

## Traps that cost real time

The browser-driving and testing traps are in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) — driving
the turn loop, getting into the debrief without touching the disk, and the stale
HMR console buffer all live there now. These are the ones specific to where the
code currently stands:

- **Sealed recordings made before 2026-08-16 that cross a minefield will fail
  `verifyRecording`.** Decision 10 changed how many rng draws a move near a
  charge makes. That is the tool doing its job, not a regression.
- **A rule with two halves is where the bugs have actually been.** Three of the
  five decisions settled on 2026-08-16 turned up real defects, and every one was
  two halves of a single rule applied at different layers or measured off
  different geometry — each half defensible alone. When you touch one half, go
  and read the other.
- **`addUnit` records the force as it stands.** Setting `camouflaging` or
  `baseCover` after adding a unit desyncs the recording from the live game — the
  replay gets an undressed unit. Set it before `addUnit`.
